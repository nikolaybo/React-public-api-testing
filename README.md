# React Vite TypeScript Boilerplate

A modern and scalable frontend boilerplate built with **React 19**, **Vite**, **TypeScript**, and **React Router v7**.
This project is designed as a reusable foundation for dashboards, admin panels, and production-ready web applications, with a focus on modern routing, performance, and scalability.

---

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

This boilerplate follows a **feature-based and modular architecture** that promotes scalability, maintainability, and a clear separation of concerns.

### Core Principles

- **Feature-oriented structure**  
  Application logic is grouped by feature inside `modules/`, making the codebase easier to scale and maintain.

- **Separation of concerns**  
  API communication, services, UI components, hooks, and utilities are organized into dedicated layers.

- **Centralized routing**  
  All routing logic is centralized in `routes/` using React Router v7, supporting nested layouts, public and protected routes, role-based access control, and a clear separation between routing and UI.


- **Reusable building blocks**  
  Shared components, hooks, and utilities are centralized to reduce duplication and improve consistency.

- **Type-safe by default**  
  TypeScript is used throughout the project to improve reliability and developer experience.

- **Production-ready mindset**  
  The structure is suitable for real-world applications, not just demos or prototypes.
